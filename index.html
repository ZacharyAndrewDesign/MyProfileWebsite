        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>My name is Zachary Johnson, and I could be your next web developer!  I live in Salt Lake City, UT with my girlfriend, Emma, and my dog, Morris!  You can see a map of where we live below.<br><br>While I haven't always worked as a web developer,  my multi-faceted design experience brings together many elements that I can deliver as a user-friendly, organic, and effective application.  I hope you will read below to learn more about my strengths

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <h3>Strength in Diversity</h3>
        <p>My background is not in Computer Science, Programming, or web development.  While you can see some examples of the different fields that I have worked in, most of my experience is in Interior Design and Construction.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Architectural Design</li>
          <li>Interior Design</li>
          <li>Graphic Design</li>
          <li>Photography/Videography</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why does this give me an edge on the competition?  The fundamentals of UX design and development are essentially the same as those of Web Development:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Research & Program Client Needs</li>
          <li>Iterate Through a Concept and Design</li>
          <li>Execute Through Careful Construction</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A whimsical coincidence that connects my past experience to my current experience is the term "programming".  In architectural design programming refers to the process of gathering as much information as possible about the client, their business, and their goals in order to be able to truly change the way that they work for the better.  Often times this involves proposing a change that the client might be unfamilar or uncomfortable with.</p>
        <p>Now, as a software developer,  this gives me strength as the name takes on a new form.  By best understanding what an application aims to accomplish, I implement both meanings of the word.  What used to be called construction is now called programming and that incites a seriousness.  As an Interior Designer,  I would never start construction without best knowledge or the design/plan.  Same goes for web development. By "programming" the proper design,  I am then able to execute with less confusion and less need for iteration</p>
        <p>My interests are diverse.  I love skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, and just about any sport that involves wheels.  My passion for art and music production drives my creativity, and keeps me connected to trends.  This diversity in interests allows me to have relationships with all types of people and know what makes them tick.</p>
